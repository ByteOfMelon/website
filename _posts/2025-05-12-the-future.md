#### Current state of affairs
The "TheRandomMelon" YouTube channel has been dead for quite a while now, only being slightly reanimated when I have a random video I want to do. For instance, the last video I uploaded to the channel was [#PersonaAlert 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-7FxYBHoC8), on April 1, 2024, to commemorate a really awful video I did years ago called [#PersonaAlert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SBFmbvWCkA).

<br />
The last actual video that was uploaded was even earlier than that, on September 14, 2023, titled [Madden 24 SUCKS! - Gameplay Proving How EXPLOITATIVE Ultimate Team Is (feat. SonicHack)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp3QauHGrVo). While I like this video still, and find it pretty enjoyable to look back on, it's not the kind of content I want my (main) channel to be. This is a fun thing to do as a second channel, though, but I'm getting ahead of myself...

#### A new idea
Recently, I had a bit of an epiphany while on one of my half-hour long drives home from college. As you might imagine, I have plenty of time to think about things during these daily bits of driving, and the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct was just a few days ago at this point in time.

<br />
Since there has been a lot of misinformation spreading on the Nintendo Switch 2, I wanted to make a video titled something like "In Defense of the Nintendo Switch 2 (and things I can't defend!)", as I wanted to offer my perspective also on things that are true that I don't like about the new console. I've been giving this idea some thoughts on and off, alongside some other potential video topics, and I eventually came to the realization that I wanted a format change:

#### The format change
The best way I can immediately describe my concept for my new content format is to describe it as "a mix of Scott the Woz and Arlo". I want to dive pretty deeply into various different technology and gaming concepts, and specific bits of tech and games as well, while having a comedic element strung throughout, and more on-camera appearances in a similar vein to my [review of the M1 Mac mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqLFMITB2s4&t=55s). I, of course, will be aiming to put my own spin on things so that it doesn't just feel like I'm ripping off other YouTube channels.

<br/>
However, I quickly came to a realization after thinking up this new format idea:

#### It's time to retire the "TheRandomMelon" brand
At this point, the "TheRandomMelon" brand has become pretty iconic and intrinsically linked to me. However, it is an outdated and antiquated username that I made for myself back in 2014, when I wasn't even 10 yet (I wouldn't turn 10 until November of that year). The "Random" part in this name comes from my even older channel, named "RandomStuff", which was an even worse channel name. However, I also like the "melon" branding; I feel it is fairly unique and, with the right name and branding, could still work. Therefore:

#### Introducing: Byte of Melon!
After many iterations and discussions with various friends of mine, I have finally landed on a new channel name, **Byte of Melon**! Not only is Byte of Melon a pun (you can bite a melon, and a "byte" is a group of binary digits, making it a pun), but it also describes what I want to do on this channel quite perfectly.

#### What does this hold for the future?
I will begin sunsetting the name "TheRandomMelon" in almost all contexts and areas. Some TRM pages will simply be archived and left as is, such as the YouTube channel, others will be used for some other purposes (like my X account already is used for), and some pages will be renamed to Byte of Melon, such as my Twitch channel and Discord server.

<br/>
Additionally, my second channel, TRM Extras, will simply be renamed to "Bit of Melon" (another pun, as 1 byte = 8 bits). Some of the oldest content on that channel will be unlisted, but still findable in a public playlist on the channel page.

<br/>
These renames and archivals will begin taking place soon after this post is published to this website. Speaking of this website, I have also purchased [byteofmelon.com](https://byteofmelon.com), however, it only redirects you to this website for now. Eventually, this site will be properly ported over to that domain as well.
